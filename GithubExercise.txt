Bless us all TI

Chapter 1: Greg

  It was a dark and stormy night -- or maybe it was just a normal night with average lighting;
  the Cognex Vision camera wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
  Greg was just finishing up his conversation with the assortment of ABB 6-DOF industrial
  robotic arms before heading home for the night. The arms waved to him as he wheeled
  his fixed-gear bike out the doors of the robotics lab. He walked down the main hallway
  of SW9 past the lecture hall and straight into the doors to exit the building. Whoever
  installed those doors must have used feet for proximity detection instead of meters, or
  they simply intended for people to take a nap while waiting for them to open. Greg
  hardly felt the impact, though, and continued out into the evening light.

  As he mounted his bike and prepared for his journey home, he felt the urge to stop. I'm not
  sure if he pulled the brakes or simply stopped moving his feet; the fixed-gear mechanism
  would have allowed him to do either. Greg shifted his focus toward SW3 and became
  mesmerized by the soft glow emanating from the area where students lock up their bikes.

  Greg approached the entrance to the main building of SW3, closest to the parking lot and
  locked up his bike. The stream of colours radiating through the window from the stairwell
  was intense: he couldn't help but to further investigate. Walking down the single
  flight of stairs to the basement level, the glow became a vibrant red. He peered through
  the locked double doors that ironically instructed security to not lock them. He was just
  able to differentiate the room label from the bath of red that surrounded him, when he
  heard the large vent to his back right rattle. He began to collapse instantaneously.
  His vision quickly blurred as the word "Planetarium" melted into darkness.


Chapter 2: Andrew

  Andrew has been sprinting in the forest for twenty days. "Andrew! You got us lost!", 
  Andrew has been walking in the forrest for seven days. "Andrew! You got us lost!", 
  he yelled into the void. A short time later a mythical creature, that may or may not 
  have just been an oversized opossum, hollered back,  "Where is your state diagram?!" 
  Puzzled by the words of wisdom, Andrew reached for a branch and began to draw.

  Casting his eyes downward Andrew assessed the ground and found it too hard and rocky
  to be able to properly illustrate what would surely be a masterpiece of a state diagram.
  Upon this realization Andrew set off in search of ground more favourable for drawing on.

  Andrew walked until he came to a river. On the bank of the river was a flat soft muddy
  expanse perfect for drawing state diagrams. The only thing marring the surface were
  curious footprints. Ignoring the footprints (animal?, human?) Andrew started to draw
  a pristine state diagram representing .....

Chapter 3 (credit: ChatGPT)

As Andrew meticulously sketched out the beginnings of his state diagram on the soft, muddy bank of the river, his mind buzzed with questions. What had led him into this labyrinthine forest in the first place? How had he managed to get so utterly lost? And who, or what, was that mysterious creature that had spoken to him moments ago?

Lost in thought, Andrew traced the lines of his diagram, his fingers sinking into the moist earth as he drew. Each symbol he etched into the mud seemed to whisper secrets to him, guiding his hand as he mapped out the intricate pathways of his mind.

But as he worked, a nagging sensation tugged at the edges of his consciousness. The footprints he had noticed earlier, scattered haphazardly across the muddy bank, refused to be ignored. They seemed to dance around the edges of his vision, taunting him with their enigmatic presence.

Determined to unravel the mystery, Andrew set aside his diagram and knelt down beside the nearest set of prints. They were small, delicate, unlike any he had ever seen before. And yet, there was something oddly familiar about them, something that sent shivers down his spine.

With a sense of trepidation, Andrew followed the trail of footprints as they wound their way along the riverbank, disappearing into the dense undergrowth beyond. Each step brought him closer to the truth, closer to the heart of the forest's mysteries.

And then, suddenly, he found himself standing before a hidden clearing, bathed in dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy above. At its center stood a solitary figure, her form blurred by the shifting shadows.

"Who are you?" Andrew called out, his voice echoing through the stillness of the forest.

The figure turned, her face hidden beneath the folds of a hooded cloak. And yet, despite the darkness that surrounded her, there was a warmth in her eyes, a familiarity that tugged at Andrew's heart.

"I am the guardian of this forest," she replied, her voice soft as the whisper of the wind. "I have watched over its secrets for countless generations, guiding those who seek the truth."

Andrew stepped forward, his heart pounding in his chest. "What truth?" he asked, his voice barely more than a whisper.

The guardian smiled, her lips curving into a gentle arc. "The truth that lies within you," she said. "The truth that only you can discover."

And with that, she vanished into the shadows, leaving Andrew alone in the heart of the forest, his mind ablaze with wonder and possibility.

With newfound determination, Andrew returned to his state diagram, his hand steady as he traced out the patterns of his thoughts. For he knew now that the journey he had embarked upon was not just one of navigation, but of self-discovery—a journey that would lead him to the very depths of his own soul.

NARRATOR:
(Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
According to all known laws
of aviation,
 :
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
 :
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
 :
The bee, of course, flies anyway
 :
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
